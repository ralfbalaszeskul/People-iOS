# People
## Summary
The new attempt to write a software for the documented relationship with humans. It is intended for team leaders, teachers, coaches or genealogists.
The idea is to create an app for iPhone, iPad and Mac with offline data storage and synchronization with backend (iCloud or rest server).

## Backlog
- Name, first name (detail, list, search)
- Anniversaries (detail, list, search / filter)
- Texts and pictures (detail, personal details, list)
- Relationship to each other (family relationship, student-teacher relationship)
- Augmented Realaty: human with title (iOS feature)
- Special fields: wishes etc
- Special property: students, staff, athletes etc
- Event type (sports, class work, objective review) with appointment list and dynamic fields
- pdf export, book export, export as archive, simple text export (md)
- Import
- Abomodell

## Principle: "Do everything right"
- Openness: My ideas should be fruitful for others. The ideas of other developers can be incorporated. Openness demands quality and effort for clarity. I am not alone in the world and I want to strengthen the exchange of ideas.
- English: Expressing myself in a foreign language should be exercise for me
- Good architecture: In an open source project, you can try architecture and exchange ideas. For slightly more complicated iOS apps, Viper (see https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) appears clear and understandable
- Good test coverage, automated tests and builds: 
- Complete technical documentation
- Continuous work
- Continuous paid provision through app stores
